[#release-notes-${release.version?replace("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "-", "r")}]
== ${release.version}

This release provides a continuation of the modularisation process of Log4j Core.
The following features were moved to separate artifacts:

* The async logger feature was moved to `log4j-async-logger` and it was upgraded to use LMAX Disruptor 4.x.
The async appender is still available by default in `log4j-core`.
* The YAML configuration is available now in `log4j-config-yaml`.
* The Java properties configuration was removed and replaced with a similar format based on https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/tree/2.17/properties[`jackson-dataformat-properties`].

Other features were removed:

* Jetty 9.x users are encouraged to migrate to Jetty 10.x or later and replace `log4j-appserver` with `log4j-slf4j2-impl`.
* Tomcat JULI support is available from a third-party project (cf.
https://oss.copernik.eu/tomcat/3.x/components/tomcat-juli-to-log4j[`tomcat-juli-to-log4j`]).
* Apache Commons Logging users are encouraged to upgrade `commons-logging` to version 1.3.0 or later and remove `log4j-jcl`.
* Support for the XML layout was dropped.
* Support for JMX was dropped and will be replaced with a more recent technology.
